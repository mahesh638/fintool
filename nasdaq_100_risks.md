The company manages these risks through established interest rate risk limits and monitoring interest rate sensitivities of its debt portfolio.<br>- Regulatory Approval for Spectrum Acquisitions: T-Mobile's acquisition of spectrum licenses is subject to regulatory approval, which can delay transactions and affect strategic plans. The company has deferred closings for certain licenses to expedite the approval process, highlighting the dependency on regulatory timelines.<br>- Exclusive Forum Provision: T-Mobile's Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole forum for certain legal actions, potentially limiting stockholders' ability to choose their preferred judicial forum. This provision may discourage lawsuits against the company, even if such actions could benefit stockholders. | - **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes** |
| 85 | TSLA | FY2023 | - Regulatory and Legal Challenges: Tesla faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny and legal proceedings, including investigations by agencies such as the SEC and DOJ. These inquiries cover areas like Autopilot, FSD capabilities, and data privacy, and unfavorable outcomes could harm Tesla's business, financial position, or brand reputation.<br>- Supply Chain Dependencies: Tesla relies heavily on suppliers, including single-source suppliers, for components critical to its products. Any disruption in the supply chain, inability to secure components at acceptable prices, or inefficiencies in managing supplier relationships could materially impact operations and financial results.<br>- Capital and Liquidity Risks: Tesla's operations and expansion plans are capital-intensive, and the company may need additional funding. If funds are unavailable on favorable terms, it could adversely affect Tesla's financial condition and ability to execute its growth strategy.<br>- Competition and Market Dynamics: Tesla operates in highly competitive markets for electric vehicles, energy storage, and solar products. Increased competition, changes in consumer preferences, or unfavorable regulatory changes (e.g., net metering reductions) could negatively impact market share and profitability.<br>- Technology and Product Risks: Rapid changes in product cycles or manufacturing technology could lead to early obsolescence of equipment, resulting in accelerated depreciation and financial losses.

| 86 | TTD | FY2023 | - Dual-Class Stock Structure: The Trade Desk's dual-class common stock structure grants holders of Class B shares, including founders, significant influence over corporate decisions, potentially limiting the ability of Class A stockholders to influence matters such as director elections and major transactions. This structure could discourage third-party acquisition attempts and entrench management.<br>- Litigation and Legal Proceedings: The company faced derivative lawsuits alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the CEO Performance Option. While management does not expect these proceedings to materially impact the business, litigation remains inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs and resource diversion.<br>- Foreign Currency Exchange Risk: With operations in multiple countries, The Trade Desk is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, particularly involving the Euro, British Pound, and other currencies. A 10% adverse change in exchange rates could result in a $38 million foreign currency loss, potentially impacting financial performance.<br>- Macroeconomic Uncertainty: The company highlighted risks from macroeconomic factors, which could adversely affect liquidity, working capital requirements, and overall business performance. These uncertainties may also impact the ability to raise additional capital or execute strategic initiatives.<br>- Share Repurchase Program Risks: While the board authorized a share repurchase program, it does not guarantee enhanced shareholder value or mitigation of equity dilution. The program could reduce cash reserves needed for other corporate purposes and increase stock price volatility. | - **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes** |
| 87 | TXN | FY2023 | - Debt Obligations: Texas Instruments issued $3 billion in new long-term debt in 2023, increasing its total debt to $11.3 billion. Rising interest rates or changes in credit markets could affect the cost of servicing this debt or refinancing it in the future.<br>- Foreign Exchange Risk: Texas Instruments faced exposure to fluctuations in non-U.S. currency exchange rates, which could impact its effective tax rate and financial results. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $4 million, despite hedging activities using forward currency exchange contracts with a notional value of $328 million.<br>- Interest Rate Risk: Changes in interest rates posed a risk to the fair value of the company's investments and debt. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments by $22 million and long-term debt by $891 million, although cash flows from fixed-rate debt would remain unaffected.<br>- Equity Market Risk: The company’s investments in mutual funds, venture capital funds, and nonmarketable equity securities were subject to market fluctuations. These investments were used to offset liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements, but changes in their value could impact financial results.<br>- Credit Risk: Concentrations of credit risk were managed by limiting exposure to any single issuer and maintaining investment-grade ratings for counterparties. However, the company remained exposed to risks from financial institutions, customers, and issuers of debt securities, despite allowances for expected credit losses. | - **Yes**<br>- No<br>- No<br>- No<br>- No |
| 88 | VRSK | FY2023 | - Concentration of Credit Risk: Verisk’s top 50 customers accounted for approximately 45% of revenues in 2023, indicating a reliance on a concentrated customer base.

While no impairments were recorded in 2023, the risk of future impairments remains if asset carrying values exceed undiscounted cash flows.<br>- Litigation and Contingent Liabilities: Verisk accrues costs for litigation and claims when liabilities become probable and estimable. Indemnification agreements for intellectual property breaches and other risks could lead to unpredictable future payments, although most agreements limit maximum liability. | - **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes** |
| 89 | TTWO | FY2024 | - Goodwill Impairment: The company recognized a significant goodwill impairment charge of $2,342.1 million in FY2024 due to reduced forecasted performance of a reporting unit caused by industry conditions and strategic changes. This highlights the risk of further impairments if business performance or market conditions deteriorate.<br>- Revenue Recognition Challenges: Changes in accounting standards and evolving business models, such as post-release content updates and online-enabled features, could require revenue to be recognized over longer periods. This could adversely affect reported financial results, even if cash flows remain unaffected.<br>- Economic and Consumer Spending Risks: Declines in consumer spending or adverse economic conditions could materially impact the company’s financial performance. This risk is particularly relevant given the discretionary nature of gaming and entertainment spending.<br>- Tax and Regulatory Risks: Changes in tax laws, such as the capitalization of R&D expenditures under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could adversely affect the company’s effective tax rate and financial condition. Additionally, audits and uncertainties in tax estimates pose risks to earnings.<br>- Foreign Currency Exchange Risks: Take-Two Interactive faced risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly due to the devaluation of the Turkish Lira against the U.S. Dollar, which negatively impacted results.

These factors could affect the company's ability to achieve its strategic objectives and financial targets.<br>- Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risks: The company faced exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes, which could impact its financial position and cash flows. Derivative instruments were used to mitigate these risks, but market volatility could still affect earnings.<br>- Debt and Financial Leverage: With $43.9 billion in fixed-rate senior notes and significant noncurrent debt, the company was exposed to risks related to interest rate changes and refinancing. A 100 basis-point increase in interest rates could decrease the fair value of its debt by approximately $2.9 billion.<br>- Goodwill and Impairment Risks: The Studios and Networks reporting units had limited headroom (15% and 5%, respectively) between fair value and carrying value, making them more susceptible to impairment. Changes in key assumptions, such as discount rates or terminal growth rates, could lead to future impairments. | - **Yes**<br>- **Yes**<br>- No<br>- No<br>- **Yes** |

Its ability to innovate, retain customers, and maintain a competitive edge was critical to sustaining growth.<br>- Subscription Model and Revenue Fluctuations: The company's subscription-based revenue model was subject to risks such as long sales cycles, unpredictable renewal rates, and delays in reflecting economic downturns or upturns in financial results. These factors could lead to fluctuations in quarterly performance.<br>- Dual-Class Stock Structure and Governance Risks: Workday's dual-class stock structure concentrated voting power with its co-founders, limiting the influence of other shareholders. This structure, along with other governance provisions, could discourage potential mergers, acquisitions, or proxy contests, potentially impacting shareholder value. | - **Yes**<br>- No<br>- No<br>- **Yes**<br>- No |
| 93 | XEL | FY2023 | - Operational Safety and Regulatory Compliance: Xcel Energy faced risks related to operational safety, particularly in its nuclear generation facilities and other utility operations.

| 94 | ZS | FY2024 | - Debt Servicing Risk: Zscaler has substantial debt from its $1,150 million Convertible Senior Notes due in 2025. Servicing this debt requires significant cash flow, and insufficient cash flow could lead to defaults, adversely affecting financial conditions.<br>- Interest Rate Risk: The company's investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which can affect interest income and the fair market value of investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates could alter the fair value of investments by $10 million.<br>- Foreign Currency Risk: Zscaler incurs operating expenses in foreign currencies, exposing it to exchange rate fluctuations. Although most sales contracts are in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency rates could impact financial statements.<br>- Conditional Conversion Feature of Notes: If triggered, this feature allows noteholders to convert their notes, potentially requiring Zscaler to settle conversions with cash payments. This could adversely affect liquidity, especially as the maturity date approaches.<br>- Legal and Regulatory Risks: Zscaler may face litigation and regulatory investigations, which are unpredictable and could result in significant costs. Even if outcomes are favorable, litigation can divert management resources and impact operations. | - **Yes**<br>- No<br>- No<br>- **Yes**<br>- **Yes** |
